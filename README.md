# TimeTable app
Keep track of your classes with this simple app

You can find the latest apk file in the "releases" section.

# Usage
This app consists of 3 sections:

1. Calendar : Select a date and get a list of all classes on that day.

2. Courses : Shows the list of all courses. You can add/delete your courses here

* The list of classes can be edited at any time. All changes will be automatically reflected in the calendar.

3. Settings : Set the semester and segment dates to get the classes correctly. It also has a "reset" button to delete all courses and start fresh.

* A semester is divided into 3 parts. A course can go from any segment to any other. Classes can be added to a course at any time

* A class can be scheduled weekly or on a specific date

* A class turns up in calendar only if the selected date is between that class's segment dates
